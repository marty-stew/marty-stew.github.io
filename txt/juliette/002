In Hyde Park the daffodils were beginning to flower. Carlsen lay
stretched out in a deck chair, his eyes closed, his skin soaking in
the April sunlight. He had been back three months now, and he still
found everything on earth almost painfully beautiful. The earth’s
gravity still exhausted him after a few hours of being awake, so that
he usually felt a pleasant fatigue, like convalescence.

A voice said: ‘Excuse me, but aren’t you Captain Carlsen?’

He opened his eyes wearily. This was one of the penalties of
notoriety; strangers accosted him in the street. A powerfully built
young man standing against the sunlight, his hands in his
pockets. Carlsen’s stare was unwelcoming.

‘Don’t you remember me? I’m Seth Adams.’

The name meant something, but he could no longer recall what it
was. He said noncommittally: ‘Ah, yes.’
