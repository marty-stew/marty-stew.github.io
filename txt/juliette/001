Carlsen heaved himself to his feet and held out his hand. The girl's
blue eyes were very wide. 'Oh, you're Captain Carlsen! How absolutely
marvellous! Oh, I've so wanted to meet youâ€¦ Queenie, do be quiet!' The
dog had begun to yap furiously at Carlsen.  Seth snorted, 'Oh,
Christ,' and raised his eyes to heaven.

'That's all right,' Carlsen said soothingly. He knelt down and held
out his hand.

The girl said: 'Do be careful. She'll bite.' But the dog stopped
barking, sniffed his hand, then licked it. The girl said gushingly:
'Oh, she adores you. She never does that to strangers.'
