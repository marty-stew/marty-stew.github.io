        <li><a href="/juliette/002.html"><h2>Taking the Reins</h2><p>Everyone's a suspect, so the Barbies hunt for clues to clear their names. Are Lady Puddington's muddy shoes a sign of guilt — or just a fashion crime?</p></a></li>
        <li><a href="/juliette/003.html"><h2>Veering Off Course</h2><p>Denholm seems awfully suspicious... until Lady Carson reveals she might have a motive. Ken and Marcus arrive in London. Cassidy makes an unexpected move.</p></a></li>

        <li><a href="/juliette/007.html"><h2>Down to the Wire</h2><p>With the competition looming and Pepper still on the loose, the Carsons need another horse — and someone to ride her. The gang sets a trap for Giovanni.</p></a></li>
        <li><a href="/juliette/008.html"><h2>Jumping to Conclusions</h2><p>The Barbies have a plan to rescue the horses, recover the saddle and win the championship, too. But it'll take everyone on the team to pull it off!</p></a></li>
